## Context

The core feature of our weather subscription service is to **send regular weather updates** to users based on their selected city and how often they want updates (hourly, daily, in future more complex frequencies).

To do this, we rely on a **periodic background task**. This task runs in the background and sends weather emails to users at the right time. Without it, users wouldn’t get their updates, so it’s one of the most important parts of our system.

The scheduler must be **reliable and performant**, ensuring that users receive their updates with at least **99.99% success rate**. 

That’s why it’s important to carefully choose how we build and run this background task. It must be able to handle many users, retry when something goes wrong, and scale as we grow.

## Options Considered

### 1. `robfig/cron`

**Pros:**

- Precise scheduling using cron syntax (e.g., `"0 8 * * *"`)
- Simple and clean API
- Widely used and actively maintained
- Supports time zones

**Cons:**

- In-memory only: if the application restarts, scheduled jobs are lost

---

### 2. `go-co-op/gocron`

**Pros:**

- Human-readable, chainable and easy API (e.g., `.Every(1).Day().At("10:00")`)
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly

**Cons:**

- Less powerful for complex scheduling
- Newer than `robfig/cron`

---

### 3. `time.Ticker` (Standard Library)

**Pros:**

- No external dependencies
- Very lightweight
- Suitable for a single job

**Cons:**

- No support for time zones
- Not scalable for multiple independent jobs
- More boilerplate

### 4. Any cron scheduler + Redis (with leaser) 

**Pros:**

- Reliable 
- Supports multiple app instances without duplicate job execution (e.g., sending emails only once)  

**Cons:**

- Requires an additional service (Redis)
- Adds more complexity

---

## Decision

We chose **`robfig/cron`** as the scheduling mechanism for background jobs  because it is a mature, stable, and widely-used Go library that supports flexible cron expressions and reliable job execution. Also it is easy to integrate in system and we don't need to add new services.

---

## Consequences

### ✅ Positive

- Reliable scheduling with precise cron expressions
- Flexible job configuration
- Scales well with increasing system complexity
- No external dependencies or services required (no need for Redis, Cloud Tasks, etc.)

### ❌ Negative

- In-memory scheduling only — jobs are lost on app restart
- Debugging and monitoring are manually
- No built-in retry mechanism — failures need to be handled within each job
